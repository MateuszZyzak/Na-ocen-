Traditional Cars
Car bodies have come in many different types. In early days most cars were open, without a fixed top. Now, aside from convertibles, most cars are closed. The most common styles include coupes and sedans. A coupe is a two-door car with a small back seat. A sedan usually has four doors and seats four to five people. Sedans with a lift-up rear door are called hatchbacks. Sports cars are built low to the ground and usually have no back seat. Station wagons have extra carrying capacity. By the end of the 20th century, however, they had been mostly replaced by minivans and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Some cars are specially designed and built to be used for racing.

Concept Cars
When auto companies want to test out a new style or a new technology, they design a concept car. Concept cars are usually unveiled at auto shows, which are large exhibitions of cars from all over the world. Auto companies can then see how customers react to concept cars and decide what concepts should be developed. At first, an idea in a concept car may seem impractical, but after many years of development it may be found in every car on the market. For instance, the first concept car was revealed in 1938, and it included power windows. Fifty years later almost all cars had power windows. Another concept car was one that did not need a human driver, also known as a self-driving car. The concept of a self-driving car was introduced at the 1939 World’s Fair, and by the 2020s there were self-driving cars on the road. The idea of a flying car has been around almost since cars were invented. A practical working model was introduced in the 2020s, although at the time only drivers with a pilot’s license could fly it.
